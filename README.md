## USER STORY
```
AS A dog owner.
I WANT to find days and times when the weather is agreeable,
SO THAT I can take my dog to the park to have fun and play!
```

THEN I see fields to input my location and weather preferences.
WHEN I submit my preferences,
THEN I am presented with days and times where the weather meets my needs.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:

- jQuery
- HTML

## FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 
```
Areas for further development include utilizing Google Maps API, to give user nearby dog-friendly parks, and give directions to these parks. Additionally, the user could be alerted when it is time for a scheduled puppy party. This application could also be improved by including an invitation feature, allowing for users to send invites and coordinate with other dog owners for a puppy party.
